# data_analysis_with_confusion_matrix
Data analysis with confusion matrix. The project is taught by Flare Zhao in his course, "Python 3 Intro to Artificial Intelligence".

Anomaly data model is applied first to spot the outliers in the data. 

The data is then splitted into training and testing data. The knn model is trained with the training data. Predictions were made both with the training data and the testing data, accuracy scores were calculated and printed.

Confusion matrix was used to further analyze the results. More metrics were then calculated based on the values given by the confusion matrix. 

Lastly, the knn model is trained with different k numbers and the performance (accuracy) was visualized.
